> **📌 This repository is a continuation of [CCM_MADRL_MEC](https://github.com/TesfayZ/CCM_MADRL_MEC)**, which implements the Client-Master MADRL algorithm for MEC task offloading. Here, we focus specifically on analyzing the **gradient asymmetry** and **activation saturation** phenomena observed during that work.

## Motivation

During PhD research on the [CCM-MADRL algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1145/3768579) for mobile edge computing, we observed an unexpected phenomenon: **actor networks stopped updating their weights early in training** while critic networks continued learning throughout. This asymmetry was highly sensitive to learning rate configurations.

*Figure: Stopping episodes across learning rate configurations. Each cell shows when actors stopped updating (darker = earlier stopping). Only specific learning rate combinations (bottom-left) allowed training to complete.*

**Only 1 out of 16 learning rate combinations converged.** This means 93.75% of hyperparameter configurations failed—not due to suboptimal learning, but because actors stopped updating entirely. Preventing activation saturation would make many more combinations viable, dramatically reducing hyperparameter search costs and saving compute resources.

This observation motivated a deeper investigation into **why** this happens and **how** to prevent it.

## Overview

This repository contains the research paper, experimental code, and analysis for investigating **gradient asymmetry** between actor and critic networks in actor-critic reinforcement learning architectures. We identify **activation saturation** (specifically tanh saturation in actor output layers) as the root cause of premature actor convergence.

### Key Finding

Actor networks stop updating their weights early in training while critic networks continue learning. This asymmetry is caused by:

1. **Actor**: Uses tanh output activation → saturates at ±1 → vanishing gradients
2. **Critic**: Uses linear output → no saturation → healthy gradient flow

| Actor LR | Critic LR | Actor Stops At | Converged? |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| 0.1 | any | ~5 episodes | No |
| 0.01 | any | ~5 episodes | No |
| 0.0001 | 0.001 | >2000 episodes | **Yes** |

This phenomenon is **not specific to multi-agent RL**—it applies to any actor-critic architecture using bounded output activations (tanh, sigmoid) for the actor.

## Experiments

### Baseline: Stopping Episode Detection

Tracks when actor gradients vanish across different learning rate configurations.

### Mitigation Strategies Under Investigation

| Experiment | Hypothesis | Result |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| **Large Actor** | More parameters → distribute learning signal | Marginal improvement (5-28 episodes delay) |
| **LayerNorm** | Normalize pre-activations → prevent saturation | In progress |
| **Linear Activations** | Remove ReLU → allow negative flow | **Failed** - pre-activation explosion 17× worse |
| **Full Normalization** | LayerNorm on all layers | In progress |

*Note: Linear activations delayed stopping slightly but caused pre-activations to explode to ±18 million (vs ±1 million with ReLU), confirming the problem is at the tanh output layer, not hidden layers.*

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Saturation Mechanism

```
Actor output: a = tanh(z)     where z = W·h + b

When |z| > 2:
  tanh(z) ≈ ±1
  tanh'(z) = 1 - tanh²(z) ≈ 0

→ Gradients vanish at output layer
→ No weight updates propagate backward
→ Actor "stops learning"
```

### Why Critics Don't Stop

```
Critic output: Q = W·h + b    (linear, no activation)

∂Q/∂W = h                     (always non-zero)

→ Gradients flow regardless of output magnitude
→ Critic continues learning
```
